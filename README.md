Welcome to my first Vue.js project. It was made over a weekend with no prior knowledge of Vue.js.

## About

This project gets a todo list that extends a list of users and displays them in a table. The users are supposed to be clickable to show and collapse their todo lists.

## Potential Future Features/Fixes

* Have the user row color be color coded based on the number of tasks unfinished
* Refactor the components
* Get the collapsible todos to work
* add more style
* minify a final build

## Commands to set up and view the project

* Project setup
```
"npm install"
```

* Compile and run on localhost
```
"npm run serve" and then go to the localhost port
```
